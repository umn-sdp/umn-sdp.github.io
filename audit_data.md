### Quality<a name="quality"></a>

- College Actionable: "APAS Quality"

SDP tries to assign a 'quality' label to each audit. The options are

- Usable
- Questionable
- Unusable

The label is assigned by looking at the facts generated from the audit. This classification system is not always helpful, frequently flagging APAS that are fine as questionable or unusable.

A better approach is to use the Dars Error? and Reportable? attributes.

APAS that are marked as Reportable and Unerrored, but that have bizarre data should be sent to the Custom Solutions team for research.

### Errors<a name="classification_errors"></a>

- College Actionable: "APAS Classification Errors"

Details about why an APAS was marked as Questionable or Unusable
