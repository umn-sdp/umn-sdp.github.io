title: Umn Courses In Current Term
---

This view returns all courses taken by the student at a UMN campus in
the current term

Courses are still duplicated in this view because it does not filter
down to any single requirement or subrequirement. The intention is that
people will intersect this view with something like "Degree Applicable"
to get a list without duplicates
