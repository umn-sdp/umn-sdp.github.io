title: Current Term Courses
---

This view uses the term_current view to filter down all students'
courses to courses taken in the current term.

Courses are still duplicated in this view because it does not filter
down to any single requirement or subrequirement. The intention is that
people will intersect this view with something like "Degree Applicable"
to get a list without duplicates
