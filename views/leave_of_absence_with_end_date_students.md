title: Leave Of Absence With End Date Students
---

Contains emplids of students that are currently on a leave of absence with a declared return date.

Since the Leave and Return dates are on different effective-dated rows, this view uses Live Peoplesoft as its source of truth. SDP's internal Degrees view only contains one of the rows this view needs.

Columns:

- emplid
- begin_date (effdt of the LEAVE prog_action)
- end_date (effdt of the RLOA prog_action)
