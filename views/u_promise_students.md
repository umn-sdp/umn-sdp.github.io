Contains emplids of students who receive the U Promise scholarship

These are student awards with a 'U Promise' item type, as identified
by the description in the ps_item_type_tbl.

We filter out estimated U Promise awards; these have an item_type
beginning with 9777.

In academic years 2010 and 2011 there was a special U Promise program
for families with higher income. We show both programs in the same column,
but flagged differently - 'U Promise' and 'Middle Income'. For students
who received both, they are displayed as 'Middle Income'.
